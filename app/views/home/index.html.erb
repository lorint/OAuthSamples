Two issues you might notice when trying to log into SoundCloud:<br />
1. If you log in using Facebook and you haven't yet chosen to allow SoundCloud to post on your facebook wall, it will generally end up on a blank screen.  Simply navigate back to our site and try logging in again and things will be fine.<br />
<br />
2. If the message "The token could not be found." is shown on SoundCloud's site, you will need to log off SoundCloud and log on again.  Then it should log in fine.<br />
